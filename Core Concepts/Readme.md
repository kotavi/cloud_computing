See LinkedIn course [Learning Cloud Computing: Core Concepts](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-cloud-computing-core-concepts-2)

### Overview

**Cloud Computing** is the delivery of computing services — including servers, storage, databases, networking, software,
analytics, and intelligence — over the Internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, 
and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, 
run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.

#### What Cloud Computing brings
- leveling the playing field for small and medium size businesses
- computing became much more efficient and cost effective
- made the organizations more agile

#### Cloud platforms provide the ability
- to leverage remote systems on demand over the open internet
- to pay for only the resources that you use
- to scale up and scale back as needed

### Cloud Computing definitions by [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/)

#### Cloud Computing characteristics
- on-demand self-service
- ubiquitous network access
- resource pooling
- rapid elasticity
- pay-per-use. 

#### Delivery models
- software as a service (SaaS)
    - Saleforce, offering CRM and sales automation services over the open internet
    - Saleforce, Google Apps for work, Microsoft 365
- platform as a service (PaaS)
    - Google App Engine, providing application development services, as well as deployment and hosting
    - supports most IaaS cloud providers
- infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
    - AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform

#### Deployment models
- private cloud - more secure
- public cloud - elastic scaling; leveraging cloud services over the open internet, using hardware and software that you don't own.
- hybrid cloud - seamless
